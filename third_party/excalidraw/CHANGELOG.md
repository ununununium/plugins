# Changelog

All notable changes to this plugin will be documented here.

## 1.0.1

- Send a static `X-Cursor-Plugin: excalidraw` header so hosts treat the server as anonymous instead of OAuth-gated. Cursor cloud agents previously reported it as needing authentication and never connected, even though the server requires no credentials.

## 1.0.0 — initial release

- Added the `excalidraw` MCP server pointing at Excalidraw's hosted Streamable HTTP endpoint (`https://mcp.excalidraw.com/mcp`).
- No auth — the public server needs no credentials.
- Logo: Excalidraw's official mark, from the `excalidraw` GitHub organization.
